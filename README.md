#  Sales Prediction using Python

This project is part of the **Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship**.  
The goal is to **predict product sales** based on the amount spent on various advertising channels such as **TV, Radio, and Newspaper** using **Machine Learning**.

---

##  Project Overview

Businesses often need to estimate how their advertising budgets affect sales.  
This project builds a **Linear Regression model** that predicts sales based on advertising spend data.

**Key Objectives:**
- Analyze relationships between marketing spends and sales.
- Build and evaluate a regression model.
- Visualize the performance of the model.
- Predict sales for new advertising values.

##  Dataset Information

The dataset used is `advertising.csv`, which includes the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|:--------|:-------------|
| **TV** | Advertising cost spent on TV (in thousands of dollars) |
| **Radio** | Advertising cost spent on Radio |
| **Newspaper** | Advertising cost spent on Newspaper |
| **Sales** | Sales generated (in thousands of units) |

##  Steps in the Project

1. **Import Libraries**
2. **Load and Explore the Dataset**
3. **Visualize Data Correlations**
4. **Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets**
5. **Train a Linear Regression Model**
6. **Make Predictions**
7. **Evaluate Model Performance**
8. **Visualize Actual vs Predicted Sales**
9. **Test on Real (User) Input**

##  Model Evaluation Metrics
The model is evaluated using the following metrics:
- **RÂ² Score**
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
---
##  Visualization
The project includes several visualizations such as:
- **Correlation Heatmap**
- **Actual vs Predicted Sales Scatter Plot**
